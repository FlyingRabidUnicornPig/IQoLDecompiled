Event Test Map - Make sure nothing gets borked between updates and a way to view every map event in one place. Add modded events as they come.

How to contribute - Not a priority, until at least dump is done, and maybe if there's more interest in the project. Need to figure out process: suggested changes to this repo will be manually modded in by me for testing/release?

Need to match releases between IQoL and here for better source control. Branches, Blames, whatever. Gonna be hell if i don't make sure these repos match.

I need to make fucking good quality videos of this project - I need money and a portfolio. Dev logs, comparison vids, idk something...
