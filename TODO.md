Event Test Map - Make sure nothing gets borked between updates and a way to view every map event in one place. Add modded events as they come.

How to contribute - Not a priority, until at least dump is done, and maybe if there's more interest in the project. Need to figure out process: suggested changes to this repo will be manually modded in by me for testing/release?

Need to match releases between IQoL and here for better source control. Branches, Blames, whatever. Gonna be hell if i don't make sure these repos match.

Ensure nothing important was broken by removing LevelEditorScene, the old map editor. Revert to an [old .dll](https://github.com/FlyingRabidUnicornPig/IQoLDecompiled/blob/11ea506258be974ae084e694bdfd1cd5fc5e1620/Assembly-CSharp.dll) to bring back the code for this class
